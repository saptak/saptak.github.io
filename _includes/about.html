    <p>
      <p>Saptak Sen loves programming, writing, speaking, traveling,
      breaking things and sometimes putting it back together. He does not love talking about himself in the
      3rd person.</p>
      <p>He worked as a product manager, software engineer, marketer at Amazon Web Services, Tetrate, Hortonworks, Microsoft,
      MyZus, AAL Infotech and other startups. </p>
      <p>Any intelligent system, whether it's a artificial intelligence system or a human system needs groundings to avoid hallucinating. <a href="https://gallery.saptak.in">Photography</a> and listening to customers keeps him grounded.
