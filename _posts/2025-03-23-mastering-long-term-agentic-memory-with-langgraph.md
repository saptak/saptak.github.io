# Long-Term Agentic Memory with Langgraph

Imagine working with a colleague who forgets every previous conversation you've had. No matter how many times you explain your preferences or share important information, they start from scratch in each interaction. Frustrating, right? This same principle applies to AI agents. For applications involving numerous user interactions and complex tasks, the ability to maintain context over time becomes crucial for both effectiveness and user satisfaction.

In this guide, we'll explore how to implement long-term memory in agentic systems using Langgraph, examining the different types of memory, their implementation patterns, and practical use cases for each.

## Why Memory Matters in Agentic Systems

Memory transforms static, isolated interactions into continuous, personalized experiences. Without memory, agents process each request independently, missing the valuable context from previous exchanges. With memory, they can:

1. **Maintain context** across multiple interactions
2. **Personalize responses** based on user preferences and history
3. **Adapt behavior** through feedback and past experiences
4. **Build more natural conversations** that don't require constant repetition
5. **Enable more complex workflows** spanning multiple sessions

As noted on the LangChain blog, "Imagine if you had a coworker who never remembered what you told them, forcing you to keep repeating that information - that would be insanely frustrating!" :antCitation[]{citations="e4fd27f6-c104-4671-bd0a-c79341a056cd"}

## Understanding Memory Types in Langgraph

Langgraph's memory architecture is inspired by human memory systems. Let's explore the three primary types of memory you can implement in your agents:

### 1. Semantic Memory: Facts and Knowledge

**What it stores:** Facts, information, preferences, and knowledge.

Semantic memory in Langgraph typically takes two forms: collections (unbounded knowledge searchable at runtime) and profiles (task-specific information with a strict schema for easy lookup). :antCitation[]{citations="3dd00f97-c0d2-478b-9bc8-52e04857d273"} This type of memory allows your agent to recall crucial information that grounds its responses, such as user preferences or domain facts.

**Implementation in Langgraph:**
```python
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore
import uuid

# Initialize the memory store
store = InMemoryStore(
    index={"embed": "openai:text-embedding-3-small"}
)

# Define namespace and store information
user_id = "user123"
namespace = (user_id, "semantic_memory")
fact_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
fact = {"favorite_color": "blue"}

# Store the fact
store.put(namespace, fact_id, fact)

# Later, retrieve facts
retrieved_facts = store.search(namespace)
