## Deployment Strategies for ADK Agents

Now that we understand the potential applications, let's explore strategies for deploying ADK agents to production environments.

### Local Development to Cloud Deployment

The journey from local development to cloud deployment typically follows these steps:

1. **Local Development**: Build and test agents using `adk web` or custom scripts
2. **Containerization**: Package your agent system in Docker containers
3. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to cloud platforms like Google Cloud
4. **API Integration**: Expose your agents via REST APIs
5. **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Set up monitoring and update processes

Let's walk through each step in detail.

### 1. Containerizing Your Agent System

Docker is an excellent tool for packaging your agent system:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for ADK agent system
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy your agent code
COPY . .

# Set environment variables
ENV PORT=8080

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "api_server.py"]
```

Your `requirements.txt` should include:

```
google-adk>=0.1.0
google-generativeai>=0.3.0
fastapi>=0.95.0
uvicorn>=0.22.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

### 2. Creating an API Server

You'll need to create an API server to expose your agent system:

```python
# api_server.py
import os
import asyncio
import json
import uuid
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel
import uvicorn
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from google.adk.orchestration import Runner
from google.adk.orchestration.session import DatabaseSessionService

# Import your agents
from your_agent_folder.agent import your_agent  # Update with your actual imports

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

app = FastAPI(title="ADK Agent API")

# Create a database session service
session_service = DatabaseSessionService(
    database_path="agent_sessions.db"
)

# Create a runner with your agents
runner = Runner(
    root_agent=your_agent,
    agents=[your_agent],  # Add all your agents here
    session_service=session_service
)

class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    query: str
    user_id: str = "default_user"
    session_id: str = None

class QueryResponse(BaseModel):
    response: str
    session_id: str

@app.post("/query", response_model=QueryResponse)
async def process_query(request: QueryRequest):
    try:
        # Get or create session ID
        session_id = request.session_id or str(uuid.uuid4())
        
        # Check if session exists
        existing_sessions = session_service.list_sessions(
            app_name="AgentAPI",
            user_id=request.user_id
        )
        
        existing_session_ids = [session.id for session in existing_sessions]
        
        if not request.session_id or request.session_id not in existing_session_ids:
            # Create a new session
            session_service.create_session(
                app_name="AgentAPI",
                user_id=request.user_id,
                session_id=session_id
            )
        
        # Create a message from the query
        from google.generativeai.types import content_types
        from google.generativeai.types.content_types import Part
        
        content = content_types.Content(
            role="user",
            parts=[Part.from_text(request.query)]
        )
        
        # Run the agent
        response = await runner.run_async(
            user_id=request.user_id,
            session_id=session_id,
            content=content
        )
        
        # Extract the response text
        response_text = None
        for event in response.events:
            if event.type == "content" and event.content.role == "agent":
                response_text = event.content.parts[0].text
                break
        
        if not response_text:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to generate response")
        
        return QueryResponse(
            response=response_text,
            session_id=session_id
        )
    
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8080))
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

This API server:
- Exposes an endpoint for querying your agents
- Manages sessions for conversation continuity
- Provides a health check endpoint for monitoring
- Handles errors gracefully

### 3. Cloud Deployment Options

Several cloud platforms are suitable for deploying ADK agents:

#### Google Cloud Run

Google Cloud Run is an excellent choice for ADK deployment due to its simplicity and scalability:

```bash
# Build the container
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/adk-agent-api

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy adk-agent-api \
  --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/adk-agent-api \
  --platform managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --region us-central1 \
  --set-env-vars "GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

#### Google Kubernetes Engine

For more complex deployments, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides greater control:

```yaml
# deployment.yaml

        env:
        - name: GOOGLE_API_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: api-keys
              key: google-api-key
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "2Gi"
          limits:
            cpu: "2"
            memory: "4Gi"

```

#### 5. Monitoring and Logging

Implement monitoring and logging:

```python
# monitoring.py
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.cloud_trace import CloudTraceSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.fastapi import FastAPIInstrumentor

# Set up OpenTelemetry with Google Cloud Trace
tracer_provider = TracerProvider()
cloud_trace_exporter = CloudTraceSpanExporter()
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(
    BatchSpanProcessor(cloud_trace_exporter)
)
trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

# Instrument FastAPI
def instrument_app(app):
    FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app(app)

# Add custom spans for agent calls
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

async def run_agent_with_tracing(runner, user_id, session_id, agent_name, content):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span(f"run_agent_{agent_name}"):
        return await runner.run_async(
            user_id=user_id,
            session_id=session_id,
            content=content,
            agent_name=agent_name
        )
```

## Best Practices for Production ADK Systems

Based on our experience, here are key best practices for production ADK systems:
