# Fine-Tuning Small LLMs with Docker Desktop - Part 6: Production, Monitoring, and Scaling

Welcome to the final part of our comprehensive series! In [Part 5](/2025/07/25/fine-tuning-small-llms-part5-deployment/), we successfully deployed our fine-tuned model with a complete stack. Now we'll take it to the next level with **production-grade monitoring, scaling, security, and optimization** to ensure your LLM service runs reliably at scale.

## 📁 Reference Code Repository

### Stopping and Removing Services

To stop and remove the running services, you can use the `docker-compose down` command. This will stop all the running containers and remove them, along with the networks that were created.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

If you also want to remove the volumes that were created, you can use the `-v` flag:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

All production code, monitoring configurations, and optimization tools are available in the GitHub repository:

**🔗 [fine-tuning-small-llms/part6-production](https://github.com/saptak/fine-tuning-small-llms/tree/main/part6-production)**

```bash
# Clone the repository and set up production monitoring
git clone https://github.com/saptak/fine-tuning-small-llms.git
cd fine-tuning-small-llms

# Set up production monitoring
./part6-production/scripts/setup_monitoring.sh

# Deploy with production optimizations
./part6-production/scripts/production_deploy.sh
```
